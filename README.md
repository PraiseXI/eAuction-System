# eAuction-System
> Praise Olawuni - Spring 2021
>> A prototype for an eAuction System

# Additional Notes
* Allows multiple users to conduct auctions electronically.
* Once a user has setup an account, they are able to act as a seller and start an auction by listing an item to be sold.
* They may also act as a buyer by browsing auctions that are in progress and bidding on any item whose auction has not closed.

# What I am employing
* Object Oriented approach.
* Utilising UML diagrams to know the blueprint pf the system.
